	<h3>Welcome to the intuitive playlist generator that will
	introduce you to top tracks of genres and countries</h3>

	<p>
		Any user can utilize the application to create private playlists for
		their personal use or join their friends in making a collaborative
		playlist. The application works by prompting a user for an artist,
		genre, and/or country that they want to explore, and InstaDJ will add
		the top tracks from the selection into the user’s playlist. In addition
		to allowing the user to quickly populate their playlist, the
		application also allows them to narrow their focus to specific albums
		or songs. Upon making a selection, the user will also be shown related
		artists or genres that they can choose to further fill out their
		playlist.
