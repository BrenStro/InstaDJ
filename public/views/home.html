	<h1>InstaDJ</h1>

	<p>InstaDJ is an intuitive, collaborative playlist generator that exposes
		users to new artists and genres. Any user can utilize the application
		to create private playlists for their personal use or join their friends
		in making a collaborative playlist. The application works by prompting
		a user for an artist, genre, and/or country that they want to explore,
		and InstaDJ will add the top tracks from the selection into the userâ€™s
		playlist. In addition to allowing the user to quickly populate their
		playlist, the application also allows them to narrow their focus to
		specific albums or songs. Upon making a selection, the user will also
		be shown related artists or genres that they can choose to further
		fill out their playlist.</p>
